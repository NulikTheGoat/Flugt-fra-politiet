**On EACH FRIEND'S computer:**

## ❓ Problems? Here's how to fix them!

### "It says 'npx' is not recognized"
You need to install Node.js first (go back to Step 1)

### "Nothing happens when I type npx serve"
Wait a bit! It can take 10-30 seconds the first time.

### "The game is just a black screen"
Make sure you opened `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, NOT by double-clicking the index.html file!

### "Port already in use"
Someone else is using that port. Try:
```
npx serve -l 8080
```
Then go to `http://localhost:8080` instead

### "I closed the black window by accident"
Just do the Command Prompt steps again!

### "Multiplayer: Can't connect to server"
- Make sure you ran `npm start` (not `npx serve`) for multiplayer
- Check that port 3000 and 3001 aren't blocked by firewall
- All players must be on the same WiFi/LAN network

### "Multiplayer: Room code doesn't work"
- Make sure the host's server is still running
- Double-check you typed the code correctly (6 letters)

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Environment is Destructible** - You can smash through almost any building if you have enough speed (> 20 km/h).
- **Don't stop!** - If police catch you standing still, you're arrested in 3 seconds
- **Crash into police** - Going fast? Ram them to damage their cars!
- **Collect Cash** - Cash stacks are worth more at higher Heat Levels.
- **Watch your health** - When it's low, your car gets slower and harder to control
